# SparkForge Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to clean up redundancies and over-complicated code in the SparkForge project. The goal is to reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and create a more focused codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Major Issues Identified
1. **Excessive Copyright Headers** - 80+ lines per file (Critical)
2. **Duplicate Package Configuration** - Both setup.py and pyproject.toml (Critical)
3. **Massive Error Handling Redundancy** - 62+ error classes across 13 files (High)
4. **Over-Engineered Logging System** - 2500+ lines of logging code (High)
5. **Type System Over-Complication** - 800+ lines of type definitions (Medium)
6. **Execution Engine Confusion** - Multiple overlapping execution systems (Medium)
7. **Validation Logic Redundancy** - Scattered validation logic (Medium)

### Quantified Impact
- **File Size Reduction**: ~30% possible by removing copyright redundancy
- **Error Classes**: 62 → 8 (87% reduction)
- **Logging Code**: 2500+ lines → ~800 lines (68% reduction)
- **Type Definitions**: 800+ lines → ~300 lines (62% reduction)
- **Setup Files**: 2 → 1 (50% reduction)
