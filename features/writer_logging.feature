Feature: Writer Logging
  As a data engineer
  I want to log pipeline execution results
  So that I can track pipeline performance and debug issues

  Background:
    Given I have a Spark session configured
    And I have a writer configured for logging

  Scenario: Log successful pipeline execution
    Given I have a pipeline execution result
    When I write the execution result to logs
    Then the log entry should be created successfully
    And the log should contain execution details
    And the log should contain performance metrics
    And the log should contain data quality metrics

  Scenario: Log pipeline execution with errors
    Given I have a pipeline execution that failed
    When I write the execution result to logs
    Then the log entry should be created successfully
    And the log should contain error details
    And the log should contain debugging information
    And the log should contain suggestions for resolution

  Scenario: Log step-by-step execution details
    Given I have a pipeline with multiple steps
    When I execute the pipeline
    Then each step should be logged individually
    And step logs should contain timing information
    And step logs should contain data quality metrics
    And step logs should contain resource usage

  Scenario: Query and analyze execution logs
    Given I have execution logs in the database
    When I query the logs for a specific time period
    Then I should receive relevant log entries
    And I should be able to filter by pipeline name
    And I should be able to filter by execution status
    And I should be able to analyze performance trends

  Scenario: Handle high-volume logging
    Given I have a high-frequency pipeline
    When I execute the pipeline multiple times
    Then logging should not impact performance significantly
    And all executions should be logged
    And the log data should be efficiently stored
    And I should be able to query recent logs quickly

  Scenario: Log data quality metrics
    Given I have data with quality issues
    When I execute the pipeline
    Then quality metrics should be logged
    And quality trends should be tracked
    And quality alerts should be generated when thresholds are exceeded

  Scenario: Export logs for analysis
    Given I have execution logs in the database
    When I export logs for analysis
    Then I should receive logs in a structured format
    And the export should include all relevant fields
    And the export should be performant for large datasets
