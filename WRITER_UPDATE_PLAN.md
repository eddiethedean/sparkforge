# Writer Module Update Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for updating and enhancing the `sparkforge/writer.py` module to align with the current SparkForge architecture, improve type safety, add comprehensive testing, and integrate with the existing codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Functionality
- **MinimalLogRow**: TypedDict for log row structure
